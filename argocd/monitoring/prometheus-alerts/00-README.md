# Priority levels

We use these 4 levels in our Prometheus alerts. They are based on the Incident.io article [Differences between severity and priority](https://incident.io/blog/differences-between-severity-and-priority).

## Priority 1 (P1)

A P1 incident is high-priority. No matter what else is going on, a P1 incident takes precedence over all other activities and needs to be handled immediately.

## Priority 2 (P2)

P2 incidents are urgent, but you don't necessarily need to mobilize your response team in the middle of the night.

## Priority 3 (P3)

A P3 incident can be handled the next business day without giving your incident response team more gray hairs.

## Priority 4 (P4)

You can address a P4 incident during regular maintenance. It needs to be resolved, but there's not a lot of urgency to it.
